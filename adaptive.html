        <p>Adaptive Swim was the reason Dive IN! was founded. It is a program to help hedgehogs with disabilities, and spread the love of swimming to all hedgehogs. It is based on science, and has obvious results. Adaptive Swim uses specialized procedures to help hedgehogs with special needs. In a survey, 90% of hedgehog parents said that their children were happier after the lessons.</p>
